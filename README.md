# idle_OSINT

Just an OSINT automaton tool. The goal is to make an easy-to-use GUI to aid in investigations. This is a very early work in progress as I learn a new framework.

Lots of existing tools are all CLI-based and require you to install dependencies. I want something that is cross-platform and plug-and-play.

## TODO:

### A. UI/UX Changes
- Add checkbox functionality
- Add ability to use personal API keys
- Change sizing
- Add autopopulating map for IP location

### B. Tools to Add
- Shodan
- Census
- DNSDumpster
- OPSWAT MetaDefender
- Whois
- Tor
- VirusTotal
- AlienVault OTX
- General Threat IP lists (maybe from Maxmind/SANS/etc)
- URLScan
- BuiltWith
